### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Program Lenguage: Python

Objective: 


    This script serves as an automatic file synchronization tool between two specified directories, pathOrigin and pathDestination. 

    The script continuously monitors changes each 60 seconds in the pathOrigin directory and replicates those changes in the pathDestination directory in real-time.

    It includes features such as file copying, creation of new directories, and removal of files and directories that no longer exist in the source directory.
    
Usage:
    
    Specify the paths for pathOrigin and pathDestination to define the source and destination directories, respectively.
    
    Specify the path for the LogFile creation
    
    Configure the desired interval time duration for synchronization using timerDuration.
    
    Run the script, and it will continuously synchronize files and directories between the specified locations.
